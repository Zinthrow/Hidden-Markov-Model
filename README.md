# Hidden-Markov-Model
An example of the common Hidden Markov Models implemented with the Forward algorithm and Viterbi algorithm. 

These programs discover:
How likely an HMM is to have generated a give sequence  -Forward Algorithm
What is the most likely "path" for a gernating a sequence of observations - Viterbi

Given:
The tranistion probabilities
The emission probabilities
The sequence
